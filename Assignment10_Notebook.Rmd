Load data

load("data/ylperu.dat")
```

We are interested in receptive vocabulary growth (ppvtraw), and whether this can be predicted by wealth index (wi) and rural/urban status at round 1 (typesite). 

A. Build and test a latent growth model in which wi at Round 1 is a covariate of both the slope and the intercept latent variables making up the growth model.  What does the model tell us?

Let's make a smaller dataset with only the variables of interest. 

```{r}
new_peru.dat <- peru.dat %>% 
  select(childid, round, wi, ppvtraw, typesite)
```

Because we are looking at these different variables by round, we should transform the dataset to wide format, so that we can differentiate between each variable at different time points. 

```{r}

wide_wi <- new_peru.dat %>% 
  select(-ppvtraw, -typesite) %>% 
  spread(key = round, value = wi, sep = "_wi_") 

wide_ppvtraw <- new_peru.dat %>% 
  select(-wi, -typesite) %>% 
  spread(key = round, value = ppvtraw, sep = "_ppvtraw_") 
 
wide_typesite <- new_peru.dat %>% 
  select(-wi, -ppvtraw) %>% 
  spread(key = round, value = typesite, sep = "_typesite_")

wide_peru1.dat <- left_join(wide_wi, wide_ppvtraw, by = "childid")

wide_peru.dat <- left_join(wide_peru1.dat, wide_typesite, by = "childid")

wide_peru.dat %>% 
  na.omit()

```

```{r}
lgm1 <- 
'
  i =~ 1*round_ppvtraw_2 + 1*round_ppvtraw_3 + 1*round_ppvtraw_4 + 1*round_ppvtraw_5
  s =~ 1*round_ppvtraw_2 + 2*round_ppvtraw_3 + 3*round_ppvtraw_4 + 4*round_ppvtraw_5

  i ~ round_wi_1
  s ~ round_wi_1
'
fit_lgm1 <- growth(lgm1, data = wide_peru.dat)
summary(fit_lgm1, fit.measures = TRUE, standardized = TRUE)

```
Regressions and covariances

```{r}
resid(fit_lgm1, type = "normalized")

```

Re-specify

```{r}
lgm2 <- 
'
  i =~ 1*round_ppvtraw_2 + 1*round_ppvtraw_3 + 1*round_ppvtraw_4 
  s =~ 1*round_ppvtraw_2 + 2*round_ppvtraw_3 + 3*round_ppvtraw_4 

  i ~ round_wi_1 + round_wi_2 + round_wi_3 + round_wi_4 
  s ~ round_wi_1 + round_wi_2 + round_wi_3 + round_wi_4
'
fit_lgm2 <- growth(lgm2, data = wide_peru.dat)
summary(fit_lgm2, fit.measures = TRUE, standardized = TRUE)
resid(fit_lgm2, type = "normalized")
```
Now add covariances between wealth index 

```{r}

lgm3 <- 
'
  i =~ 1*round_ppvtraw_2 + 1*round_ppvtraw_3 + 1*round_ppvtraw_4 
  s =~ 1*round_ppvtraw_2 + 2*round_ppvtraw_3 + 3*round_ppvtraw_4 

  i ~ round_wi_1 + round_wi_2 + round_wi_3 + round_wi_4 
  s ~ round_wi_1 + round_wi_2 + round_wi_3 + round_wi_4

  round_wi_1 ~~ v*round_wi_1
  round_wi_2 ~~ V*round_wi_2
  round_wi_3 ~~ V*round_wi_3
  round_wi_4 ~~ v*round_wi_4

  round_wi_2 ~ round_ppvtraw_2
  round_wi_3 ~ round_ppvtraw_3
  round_wi_4 ~ round_ppvtraw_4

  
'
fit_lgm3 <- growth(lgm3, data = wide_peru.dat)
summary(fit_lgm3, fit.measures = TRUE, standardized = TRUE)
resid(fit_lgm3, type = "normalized")

```
Much worse - not the case that variances between time points is the same


```{r}
lgm4 <- 
'
  i =~ 1*round_ppvtraw_2 + 1*round_ppvtraw_3 + 1*round_ppvtraw_4 
  s =~ 1*round_ppvtraw_2 + 2*round_ppvtraw_3 + 3*round_ppvtraw_4 

  i ~ round_wi_1 + round_wi_2 + round_wi_3 + round_wi_4 
  s ~ round_wi_1 + round_wi_2 + round_wi_3 + round_wi_4

  round_wi_2 ~ round_ppvtraw_2
  round_wi_3 ~ round_ppvtraw_3
  round_wi_4 ~ round_ppvtraw_4

'
fit_lgm4 <- growth(lgm4, data = wide_peru.dat)
summary(fit_lgm4, fit.measures = TRUE, standardized = TRUE)
resid(fit_lgm4, type = "normalized")
```
Better, but still evidently not helpful to specify covariance. 

Plot

```{r}
new_peru.dat %<>% 
  filter(wi != "NaN") %<>% 
  mutate(wi_level = cut(wi, 3, labels = c("Low", "Medium", "High")))
 
new_peru.dat %>% 
  select(childid, round, ppvtraw, wi_level, typesite) %>% 
  filter(round != 1) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = round, y = as.numeric(ppvtraw), group = childid, colour = wi_level))+ 
  geom_line(size = 0.1, alpha = 0.15) +
  labs(title = "Plot showing receptive vocabulary in individuals over time", 
       x = "Round", y = "Receptive vocabulary") + facet_wrap(~typesite) + guides(colour = guide_legend(override.aes = list(alpha = 1))) +   theme_minimal()

```
